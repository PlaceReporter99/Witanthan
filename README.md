# Witanthan
A language that has 16,384 instructions while each character only takes a byte*

<sup><sub>*May need an additional character for certain instructions</sub></sup>

## Codepage Structure
Using the power of mathematics, the optimal distribution is 128 dynamic instructions and 128 instruction modifiers

### Dynamic Instructions? Instruction Modifiers?
* Dynamic Instructions are characters that actually carry out instructions depending on what Instruction Modifier was used last, hence the name.
* Instruction Modifiers modify what Dynamic Instructions do, hence the name. Think of it like a change of the codepage.
